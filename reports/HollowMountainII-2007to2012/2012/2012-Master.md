# 2012 --- Sledi Vetra

## Abstract

Sledi Vetra 2012 was a clear success. 
2703m of new cave passage was found, the majority of which below -600m, once again using Camp X-Ray at -550m as a base. 
The main discoveries in Vrtnarija include: the Watership Down series below Daydreamers, adding 12m of depth to the cave and taking it to -900m; about 1km of horizontal development below Stuck in Paradise (-700m); and the Apollo extensions leading off a bolt climb in the Queen’s Bedchamber. 
The Apollo extensions also ended up connecting to Waterloo in System Migovec, giving us the long sought after connection and tying in ~15 years of exploration by ICCC on Migovec. 
System Migovec is now 25592m long , 973m deep and has the distinction of being the longest cave in Slovenia. 


## Introduction

Between 13th July and 19th August 2012, Imperial College Caving Club had twenty-six members participate in the Sledi Vetra (Follow the Wind) 2012 expedition to Tolminski Migovec, Slovenia.
 
There were two major aims for this expedition. 
One was the continued exploration of Vrtnarija, where considerable efforts in 2010 and 2011 had led to the discovery of 4.4km of mainly horizontal passage, all below 500 m in depth. 
The other was to connect Vrtnarija with Sistem Migovec (SysMig), which ICCC first started exploring in 1994, thus forming the longest cave system in Slovenia. 
At the start of the expedition, Vrtnarija was 11025 m long and 888 m deep, and the smallest separation between Kavkna Jama (M2 entrance in SysMig) and Vrtnarija was 4 m (±30 m survey error).
 
In addition, an enduring desire to understand the caves of Migovec meant that surface work in Areas K, S and N (north of Kuk) was also a major consideration during the expedition.
 
A large and strong UK team, and a longer-than-usual expedition (five weeks instead of four) meant that we had sufficient manpower and time to achieve all expedition aims.
 
As in previous expeditions (’03, ’10, ’11), an underground camp (Camp X-Ray) was set up at -550 m in Vrtnarija to facilitate further exploration of the deep leads. 
Eighteen people from the UK and six Slovenes from the local JSPDT club spent nights at X-Ray for a total of 90 people-nights. 
This included three first-year cavers, all of whom contributed significantly to exploration. 
All but one pushing trips were done on overnight camps, with almost all successful exploration occurring below 500m.
 
Three separate trips were made to Kavkna Jama in an attempt to forge the connection between SysMig and Vrtnarija. 
Though an acoustic connection was made when parties sent down Captain Kangaroo in Vrtnarija could hear the sound of drilling and hammering occurring in Kavkna Jama, the actual physical connection was elusive. 
Somewhat unexpectedly, the connection was instead made in a completely separate area of the cave when Dreams for the Soul, a phreatic passage off Queen's Bedchamber in Vrtnarija, dropped into Waterloo in SysMig (all at ~-600 m).
 
Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was carried out by cavers in between underground camps. 
Most of it was concentrated in Areas K and N. 
Two pitches were dropped in N9 (a.k.a. 
Kuk Pot), with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time. 
Entrances K2, K… were also re-visited. 
K2 remains the most promising, while digging went on in K19.
 
In all we discovered 2703 m of new cave passage taking Vrtnarija to 13728 m long and 900 m deep. 
Thanks to the connection, the combined System Migovec is now 25592 m long and 973m deep, with the deepest point being Watership Down in Vrtnarija, found during this year’s expedition. 
This makes SysMig the longest cave system in Slovenia, displacing the famous Postojna Jama as the previous record holder at 20190m. 

Cave Discoveries

Our major cave finds this year are described as these separate developments within Tolminski Migovec:


## Winter Action

In October 2011, a joint effort by ICCC and JSPDT was made to forge the connection. 
While the connection was ultimately unsuccessful, important survey work of recent years’ efforts in Kavkna Jama clearly showed which part of Kavkna was closest to Vrtnarija. 
As a result, the focus of exploration shifted from the bottom of Kavkna to Wizard of Oz, a bolt climb at -350m that was pushed in 2009.
 
In the months between the October weekend and the start of the Sledi Vetra expedition, the JSPDT had multiple pushing trips at Wizard of Oz. 
The silted rift was dug through and widened to gain a fairly large, clean chamber with no obvious way on. 
A small passage about 3m from the floor was expanded into yet more narrow and muddy crawls, eventually ending in a smaller chamber. 
Once again, easy progress was hampered by an extremely tight crawl. 


## Vrtnarija / M2 (Kavkna Jama)

Three ‘connection’ trips were carried out during the expedition. 
On the first two attempts,  simultaneous trips were run to Capt Kangaroo in Vrtnarija and Wizard of Oz in Kavkna. 
Unfortunately, progress past the tight crawl in Wizard of Oz proved elusive as expanding it was slow work. 
However, on both occasions teams in Vrtnarija were able to hear the sounds of the Kavkna team drilling and hammering.
 
On the final attempt, the 8m crawl in Wizard of Oz was passed. 
The passage enlarges into an immature rift but closes down almost immediately with silt and mud flakes, without any sort of draught. 
About midway through the crawl there seemed to be a very slight draught coming from a small hole in the floor, though any pushing here would require considerable effort spent digging. 
 

## Watership Down

Watership Down is the continuation of Winter Journey, a system of abandoned bedding planes at -888m in Vrtnarija. 
Two pushing trips were carried out to explore rabbit warren-like system of crawls and chambers. 
From the Winter Journey pushing front, a series of steeply inclined bedding planes covered with a thick inch layer of mud were passed to gain a beautiful, clear static sump. 
Opposite the sump a passage leads off into a tight rift which was not pushed to its end; it is most likely a dead inlet. 
 

More interestingly, obvious traverses and windows above the sump were gained to find another crawl which ended above yet another static sump.
 
There are still undropped pitches and windows to be looked at in Watership Down, though it is unlikely more depth will be added.
 
A total of 140.96 m of passage was found in Watership Down, adding 12 m of depth to Vrtnarija. 
 

## Below 'Stuck in Paradise'

At the end of the 2011 expedition, Stuck in Paradise (P69, -680 m) was dropped and two branches of extensive horizontal passage, Salvation and Lost Miles, were found below it. 
The possibility of more horizontal development at depth made the pushing of Salvation and Lost Miles a high priority.
Salvation
The squeeze left at the end of Salvation was hammered and dug through to gain a small chamber with a roaring draught (Brave New World). 
The way on down was blocked by a big boulder choke; instead, a carefully dug hole was followed upwards into sloping, crawling passage that enlarges to walking height. 
Eventually, the passage breaks into an active streamway, with the downstream passage taking the draught.
 
The downstream passage leads to an obvious phreatic continuation, which was blocked by a collapsed ceiling. 
This boulder choke was eventually squeezed through after two trips to reach 70 m of fine sandy passage (Invictus). 
This ends in a wet pitch (~P20) that was left unpushed.
 
172.4 m of mostly horizontal passage was found in the Salvation extensions. 
 

## Lost Miles

At the end of the 2011 expedition, Lost Miles was left as a draughting boulder choke. 
This year, we managed to chisel and hammer our way through, immediately breaking out into a large chamber and storming passage (Atlantis). 
After about 100 m a junction was reached with three ways on: continuation of the passage ahead, a turning to the right, and a pitch through a hole in the floor.
 
The pitch was dropped, but leads almost immediately to a boulder choke that looks promising but needs work (Inglourious Basterd).
 
The passage the right leads to about 250 m of easy caving (Minestrone), with occasional bouts of stooping and crawling. 
It eventually ends in a small chamber, with the way on being a low crawl blocked by rubble, though there is a draught. 
However, a subsequent digging trip to get past the blockage was unsuccessful, and any further progress would require considerable effort.
 
The continuation of Atlantis led to more walking passage. 
Most exciting was the discovery of a gallery of speleothems, including a vast array of helictites, stalactites, stalagmites and columns. 
This is probably the most decorated bit of cave we have found on Migovec thus far - certainly the highest concentration of stal.
 
Atlantis eventually becomes blocked with boulders in a low-roofed passage. 
Straight on there is a tight squeeze through which the continuation of the passage is visible. 
This was unpushed. 
Instead, a squeeze under boulders on the right was passed to reach a small, dry muddy tube that popped into a small chamber. 
The way on is a 10m flat-out crawl, accompanied by the sound of water. 
The crawl emerges in a chamber at the bottom of a pitch, with a large waterfall entering from above. 
This was thus named Brezno Slapov (literally ‘waterfall pitch’).
 
A series of short cascades followed; exploration was eventually halted by the need for rope.
 
A total of 757.15 m of passage was found beyond Lost Miles.
 
Interestingly, these waterfall pitches found at the end of Brezno Slapov and Invictus are the first signs of water and active passage since Zimmer. 


## Apollo & the Milky Way

In 2011, an attempt at a bolt climb to gain a window in the Queen's Bedchamber was derailed by bands of thick, slippery mud preventing the successful installation of bolt belays. 
This year, armed with tent pegs to hammer into the mud as temporary belays, three pushing trips were required to conquer the bolt climb (Apollo, P35).
 
At the top of the climb a muddy, downward-sloping passage leads to a short pitch which lands in a large chamber. 
The passage on the right leads to a dead end; the way on is through a short bedding crawl on the left.
 
The crawl quickly widens into a small chamber with two ways on. 
Straight ahead is easy but muddy caving, eventually leading to a pitch which we suspect drops back into the Queens Bedchamber. 
On the right is a long horizontal passage, mostly requiring easy crawling or stooping (Milky Way). 
At the end of this passage is a clean-washed chamber that joins a split-pitch midway. 
A high, wet aven drops into the chamber; the water then disappears under boulders. 
A way through the boulder floor is obvious and easy, leading to a pitch. 
On a subsequent trip this pitch was dropped but not surveyed. 
 
 
Midway through Milky Way is a turning off to the left, heading south-west. 
This was pushed for about 70 m to a boulder choke that was easily passed. 
Following the draught for about 50 m, a 20 m high rift was eventually reached; this rift is most likely the continuation of the Minotaur/Guillotine rift in Vrtnarija.
 
From the rift, a horizontal, crystal-covered phreatic passage continues South-West, heading directly towards System Migovec. 
The phreatic seems to have multiple levels, as it was sometimes possible to see empty space between the boulders below.
 
A couple of climbs later, a ~30 m wet pitch was reached. 
A bigger dark space could be seen across the pitch, so a traverse line was rigged. 
After 3 m of traversing, a bolt placed by cavers in 1998 was found. 
Across the traverse lay a large chamber (~20 m wide) in the middle of which a PSS was found: Waterloo 13, 6/8/98/, JE/IMcK. 
On the last pushing day of the expedition, the connection to System Migovec was finally made! The passage was named Dreams for the Soul.
 
703.46 m of cave was found in the Apollo extensions. 


## The Throne Room

At the end of 2011 expedition there were two unpushed leads in the Throne Room: a pitch, and a window across it. 
The pitch (Why the face?) was dropped. 
The crawl below it leads immediately to a draughting pitch, which was also dropped but the passage below it quickly choked.
 
The traverse was bolted across to the window and up a steeply inclined, very loose boulder slope (Hot Pants). 
From the top of the traverse is a short climb up the slope and through a boulder choke to a fairly impressive chamber about 7 m high. 
A sandy tube goes from the edge of the chamber, blowing out; it is fairly committing and was left unpushed this expedition.
 
Two further trips were made to bolt climb up to the window in the chamber and push the passage beyond. 
This climb reached a ledge in the chamber, which gained parallel passage trending downwards at 30 degrees and pushed for 70 m (Peep Show).
 
Returning to the ledge, the upwards continuation (Undercover Squirrel) was pushed for 70 m up a couple of free climbs. 
Exploration was halted as a modest bolt climb was required to progress.
 
The area in general is of interest due to its location in the far North-East of the known cave passage - it is possible that it may access more 'deep level' galleries such as were discovered 300 m to the West within the mountain in 2003 and 2004.
 
281.61 m of passage was found in the leads off The Throne Room.

## Other Leads

### Xanadu

Xanadu is a new and exciting lead found in 2012. 
It starts from a nondescript hole in the floor in Friendship Gallery, a mere 5 minutes from Camp X-Ray en route to Big Rock Candy Mountain. 
Surprisingly, no one explored it in the 9 years since we first camped at X-Ray!
 
The climb down through the hole immediately leads to an interesting rift with different levels. 
At the bottom (~30 m below Friendship Gallery) is an active stream. 
Upstream was pushed to a wet squeeze, downstream ended in a sump.
 
However, the most promising way on is midway down the rift, where it is possible to gain a muddy, wet tube. 
Through this tube the character of the cave changes completely, with dry, muddy passage (Euphrates) instead of the clean-washed white rock of before. 
At the end of the muddy passage is a strongly draughting pitch.
 
Initial attempts to descend the pitch proved unsuccessful due to the poor quality of rock. 
The pitch remains undescended and is an exciting lead for 2013. 
 

86.69 m was found in Xanadu.

### Yorkshire

Yorkshire is the continued exploration along a narrow rift above an active waterfall at the bottom of the Lower Pleasures series, which was explored in 2011.
 
Initial narrow rift gives way to a squeeze above 2 m hole, which is followed by another squeeze into a small chamber. 
Turning left from the chamber quickly led to tight constriction from which an active stream enters and exits to the right. 
Turning right led to more narrow rift, which drops into a small pool of water after 8m. 
A stream, which enters the pool from the left, was followed downstream for another 30 m before a dried mud junction was discovered at higher level.
 
The streamway continued further, but this was not surveyed.
 
The 2012 exploration of Yorkshire found 91.18 m of passage, most of which gently sloped northward, in parallel to Highway 32, 35 m below. 


### Minotaur Rift

The squeeze left at the far end of Minotaur Rift in the 2010 expedition was pushed to difficult crawling passage, often awkward with loose, sharp rocks. 
The rift continues along the same fault line as in Minotaur rift. 
A series of boulder chokes make progress interesting, including one which involves squeezing past a sharp rock, precariously wedged above one’s head (Guillotine).

\begin{verse}
Tired of Big Passages? \\
Fed up with crystals? \\
Enough of easy pushing? \\
Brand new oversuit with no holes? \\

Or; Just bored of life \\
   and want to try your luck? \\

Then; \\ 

Go To Push Guillotine! \\

Guaranteed excitement \\
Great adventure \\
Excellent for adrenalin rush \\

Join the club of survivors! \\

Now with special rewards \\
at the far end \\

Good luck and don't forget your helmet!
\end{verse}
\attrib{Gergely}

After Guillotine is a very tight and sharp flat out crawl, sloping slightly downwards. 
The passage eventually pops out into the larger chamber. 
On inspection it proved to be a very big open fault (Razor). 
Looking up, a higher level can be observed. 
The way on continues down a small pitch and a further two climbs down. 
Unfortunately, the rift at the end gets too narrow to follow.
 
174.41 m was added to Minotaur rift.

### Stagger Lee

In 2011, a window off the side of Big Rock Candy Mountain was spotted. 
Stagger Lee is the continuation of this window located 17 m above the floor of Big Rock. 
A high traverse was set up from the second last hanger. 
It was followed by a 15 m abseil and another 5 m traverse through falling water to gain the window.
 
Following the right hand side of the wall led to a series of cascading drops (P35m) that ended on the floor of the twin shaft. 
Here, two streams combined into one active streamway beneath boulder-filled chamber.
 
The streamway continued for a further 14 m before dropping 10 m into a horizontal streamway which was later discovered to be the mouth of Soda Stream, killing interest in future exploration in this chamber. 
Nonetheless a side window heading in the general direction of  Balamory was spotted 4m from the bottom. 
 
 
A total of 145.01 m of passage was found in Stagger Lee, part of which was a resurvey of Soda Stream. 


## Surface Work

Aided by perfect weather for much of the expedition, surface work was carried out by cavers in between underground camps. 
Most of it was concentrated in Areas K and N. 
Two pitches were dropped in N9 (Kuk Pot), with the continuation visible but hampered by a lack of time.
 
Entrances K2, K6, K11, K22, K21, K23, K24, K25, and K26 were also revisited. 
K22, K24, K25 did not seem at all promising. 
Good progress was made digging K6. 
Of the remainder, K2 seems to have the most potential, though all need a lot of work before the cave ¡goes¢. 


## Contributed stories

## 2012 – Watership Down & Hot Pants

The camp was set up and exploration was in full swing. 
The way out East already had its cohort of converts. 
For me there was one pushing front which had primacy above all others – namely the deepest point in the cave. 
Winter Journey, which I had explored with Jim and Fratnik last year, had a few niggling leads but nothing stellar. 
The silt deposits and depth indicated that a sump was not far away, but the inclined bedding heading North could continue for a very long time. 
With an interest in diving the sumps, I also had a distinct interest in the flooded sections.

Luckily Clare was easily suggested with the very bottom as a target. 
One concern was that the wet pitch series through Day Dreamers had been left rigged last year – we had anticipated further trips after our last one, but weather put paid to this. 
So we took a tackle sac of string to patch the pitches where necessary.

The one negative point was my little Canon 'pocket camera', hauled with nary a care in a Pelicase through all kinds of horrific caving locations over the previous six years had finally given up the ghost – and so we had no way to photographically record where we were visiting.

A smooth trip down to Red Cow was had, just enough of the route memorised from last year to make it smooth. 
We discussed the camping potential at Red Cow (very pleasant, I think) and despaired at the (lack of) quality in the rigging on the many little climbs and occasional pitches from the bottom of Big Rock. 
“On behalf of the entire 2003 & 2004 expedition I apologise” spoke Tetley on a previous trip with Clare.

I was interested in checking out the 'downstream' sump at Red Cow, which takes the majority of the water from the Republica chamber. 
So we followed a few cascades and reached a 3 metre drop with a single bolt. 
I believe the survey starts around here, but it's difficult to say as this region is poorly PSS. 
We attached one of our ropes, I abseiled down managing to walk back in the chamber to avoid the waterfall. 
The lake at the bottom of this chamber was not in fact the sump, rather a metre wide phreatic tube led off for perhaps ten metres, finally reaching a bend where the roof continued dipping but the water stayed still and level, with pools of brown silt sitting in the otherwise pure white floor.

Derigged, we climbed up in the rift at the previous cascade, and found an obvious dry level. 
This was strange, as I knew this passage was not on the survey, but there were clear marks from cavers passing. 
Clare and I decided to give it a proper push. 
Soon we found ourselves discarding bits of SRT kit and harness. 
We made a good team, Clare wriggling off through the smallest of gaps while I continued to expand them to human size behind. 
A flat out squeeze over cobbles took a while to reengineer, and a ninety degree bend to stand up in a wriggle rift took a lot of hammering by Clare to make it passable. 
Alas, she found herself in a region, again, with obvious caver marks the far side of the tight stuff, and soon “I've been here before” as she found a Republica PSS. 
We had connected between the downstream Red Cow sump and the head of Insomnia pitch (climb back out across the pitch along the large ledges, before turning right into a chamber leading off), connecting the 'crescent' shown previously on the survey. 
This only further complicates our understanding of the hydrology here – was this the old route for the Red Cow water, did it join up at Insomnia to form that impressive pitch, before it found a way out through the present cascades and sump? Still, we had fifty-five metres of survey in the book, a good thirty of which were new, where many cavers must have stood but none decided to push. 
This also offers a tight, though not horrifically so, flood safe bypass for Republica. 
With further enlargement it could even become the through way.

So, after a couple of hours diversion, we continued to our main target – the bottom. 
Insomnia's rope was badly hung up, I had to reverse prussic about 20m directly through the water before I'd stretched enough slack to rig my descender and very very gently (checking the rope) descended & unhooked the rope from the crack it had been wedged in.

The wet ropes in Insomnia were found to be in good nick, and so we abandoned the rigging gear to speed our progress. 
Interestingly, the only place where the rope had been abraded was the natural tied off bit to help you avoid landing in the big pool. 
Here the rope had been dangling a natural 'L' shape, and being gently swung back and forwards by the draught had sliced through the sheath and most of the core where it touched the rock ridges on the floor.

Back at Winter Journey, we threw ourselves into the rift and soon reached the exploration end. 
I essentially pushed Clare into the rift taking the draught, and she started enlarging with the bolting hammer and squeezing away. 
Progress was pretty quick, but I was captivated by the inclined bedding plane leading off. 
By myself, I hadn't dared climb down this last year. 
It didn't look so bad now, and Clare would definitely be able to follow me into this 'lobster pot' if that's what it turned out to be.

So I slithered down and away, a pretty long way down over dried silt, and reached a crawl way at the bottom. 
There was a gentle draught once more. 
I called Clare down, though she had nearly made it through her upward squeeze. 
We padded off through the rabbit warren like passage, dull thuds of our paws on the soft floor. 
“Watership Down” was the obvious name for this find – especially as I knew Clare liked the book. 
A branch to the right led upwards to a pitch into a chamber. 
Continuing ahead entered a slightly more confined space and a crawlway climbing back up the bedding to reach a T-junction. 
Here a large draught blew across, coming from a crawl / stoop leading down from the right. 
The way to the left soon turned into an inclined rift climb, steeper than other bits of bedding had seemed. 
But it was negotiatiable with care. 
The next climb looked rather more committing, the walls clearly belling out into a proper chamber, and what was that dark space down there?

I must admit exploration fever had rather got me at this point, as I climbed down without too much concern for the return journey. 
I was stunned by what I climbed down towards – a large, crystal clear, sump with a clear rock arch leading off into turquoise blue depths. 
The slight seriousness of our situation was rather underlined by Clare arriving, with a clatter and a woosh as she lost her footing and nearly, in that caving cliché, fell into the terminal sump.

We ignored the inclined cliff that was our only escape, and continued exploration. 
The main sump was beautiful, but a parallel route through the rocks led to a smaller, obviously connected, body of water. 
From below, a clear balcony was visible above the sump, and with a rope, would be a passable pendulum. 
Feeding into the sump was a dry inlet, which led away through a small crawlway. 
This we pushed until it started to get rather catchy and surveyed out, though further progress is certainly possible. 
Our survey down here complete, including a plastic PSS at sump level on the sandy beach, we had to tackle the climb. 
Clare went up first, after a few false starts and slithering back down, we found a working method utilising 'combined tactics', where I would bridge across the floor and ceiling and be stood on. 
Her safely up, I slipped back down again and was lowered the end of the survey tape to complete the measurements – 9.83m to safety.

There was nothing Clare could do to help as I slipped and struggled. 
The mud on the walls had been made slimy, the footholds were degenerating. 
I slowly slithered up the far end of the rift where it was narrow and I could bridge most effectively, but therefore had to deal with overhanging sections which I scaled, somehow, with the minimum of poise and grace. 
As we surveyed out Clare had to indicate the stations again and again, the buzzing in my head was dissolving memories as fast as they were forming.

Time was pressing on and we did not have time to look at the many leads left in the  rabbit warrens. 
Instead we made a speedy exit, Clare taking the exploration bits and bobs, I choosing to pull up the ropes as there is never a guarantee of return at these extreme ends of the cave system.

Red Cow offered it's usual calming influence; the strange 'quiet corridor in an alien spaceship' feel to these horizontal sections was comforting where it had been disquieting. 
We sat there munching the food we had stashed on the way in, rehydrating even as our Meander oversuits steamed off their splashes from Insomnia and Republica. 
I thought dark thoughts about the riggers of both these pitches, in their different 'exploration rigging' ways my two most hated and, in my consideration, dangerous pitches of the cave. 
And there they were together, back to back, a gauntlet to be passed on the way to the depths, and a horrible back-of-mind barrier to the exit to safety.

The way back to camp passed smoothly. 
Back for tea and medals, talk of daring do and plans for a rather more sedate second day.

### The Day After

Our plan for the second day was rather more constructivist in intent. 
Since exploring the Throne Room last year, no one had returned except to the large obvious windows which had formed 'Amazing Grace' and the way to the East. 
Clare and I knew there to be a potential traverse, and also a short pitch. 
This area is relatively close to Camp X-Ray and so would be a good place for less experienced teams to cut their teeth. 
So we packed up the Uneo drill and made our way along Kamikaze and the Red Baron traverse. 
The leads are as we remember them, and I quickly rig up the start of the traverse and place a bolt in the large boulder for abseil (with tackle sac rope protector) into the pit. 
Confirming it's a going lead with a pitch leading off, I come back up and get stuck into the main metal of the traverse.

[Nb: If it doesn't get written up elsewhere, Nico et al. 
Dropped this pitch, and a few more climbs and cascades before it degenerated – from the survey and form of the cave, it looks as if you're descending the immature vadose formation below the throne room boulder collapse.]

The first few bolts are just fine – swing and bolt, rejiggle the rigging and move outwards one metre. 
From my perch around the corner, I realise that this is rather more demanding than had been hoped – not a traverse over the pit and into a side passage, but a continuing climb traverse out of the end of the chamber. 
I keep at it, finding passable rock to bolt in the overhung ceiling, and somehow climbing backwards over stopped boulders and chunks of dried mud. 
I am not, as it were, enjoying myself at this point. 
The bolts aren't being tested as I pass, and I'm climbing a good few metres in height between placements, on semi static rope and without a belayer, just judging the length of slack. 
Considerable quantities of footholds disappear bouncing down the slope, flying into the pit at the bottom. 
I explain this predicament to Clare. 
She replies with “Well, you don't have any choice – we don't have the dynamic rope with us and we're not going back to camp.” Charmed.

Clare, shivering on a boulder while I sweated with outstretched drill, also has an idea for the survey name – Hot Pants. 
Why? “I have a plan, and it's as hot as my pants...” - Lord Flashart

At the top I reach a little chamber with an obvious climb leading up through a boulder choke. 
The traverse rope is just long enough to belay as far as the top of the climb, but not to protect the way across. 
Feeling rather flushed and vertigous at the achievement (19.44m at 50 degrees says the survey, between here and the last traverse bolt) I finalise the rigging. 
Clare follows me on the rigged line, I watch it scratch at a particularly large pile of boulders which I didn't dare disturb – derigging from the bottom and gardening back from the top would make a lot of sense long term.

We climbed up carefully through the boulder choke and were rewarded with a beautiful little chamber, about 12 x 4 m, with a high ceiling and an obvious balcony a good four metres off the floor. 
Out of gear, we looked at the crawlway heading NNW out of the chamber. 
This was taking a distinct draught, and was easy (though rather small) going with a white silt floor. 
Clare slithered over a little dam and wriggled off, coming back to state it was going but rather small. 
I couldn't be bothered with such arduous squeezing at this stage, and expecting that this lead would be looked at first before bolt climbing plans, was happy to survey out.

Strangely, this crawl wasn't again looked at – instead the teams who came after us hand bolt climbed to the balcony and beyond, gaining passage 7 metres above the chamber floor, which led to 73 m of gently descending passage to the NNE (Peepshow), terminating at a boulder choke,  and then 78 m of gently ascending passage due North into blank mountain (Undercover Squirrel) terminating at a 4 m draughting climb into a chamber.

And that was the story of my first camping trip with Clare. 
I certainly felt rather pleased – we had gone after the lesser leads and multiplied them through our efforts. 
Finding the beautiful Watership Down sump was a joy, but the Hot Pants traverse climb was perhaps the most important work in terms of the exploration it enabled.

## Diving Dreams

A few more carries and a visit to the fleshpots and Wifi of Tolmin, and I needed to decide what to do next. 
My big hope was diving, I had stuffed a barrel full of my cave diving gear and hidden my fully pumped 7 Litre cylinders in the back of the van. 
Now with such a clear and accessible (though very remote) sump, diving was a genuine possibility. 
At first I decided the logistics were simply impossible, but there seemed to be a lot of people making positive noises about portering assistance, and so, deciding to commit, readied my gear at Ravne.

Some of the Slovenians had promised help in portering the gear to Kal, unfortunately the motorbike broke terminally while carrying the cylinders. 
Abandoned in the forest, they were carried the last zig zags by hand. 
My lead weights arrived in the Bivi almost as if by magic.

But every move closer to the pushing front had fewer and fewer volunteers. 
Offers of assistance are gladly made in the sunny cafes of Tolmin. 
Fundamentally when the choice is porterage of diving gear at the expense of dry exploration, the choice of expedition members was clear.

Ideally the diving also required the setting up of a camp at Red Cow. 
I had prepared a lightweight two-man camp for this application, and had assumed that people would at least be interested in visiting the bottom of the cave or extending the leads further North in the deep levels. 
However, one can't really direct exploration in this way, and the majority of the expedition efforts went into the extensive horizontal levels found below Stuck in Paradise – only two trips went beyond Big Rock this summer, and I was on both of them.

I solo'd my way to X-Ray with a 7 Litre bottle and fin in a tacklesac, and a weight belt of 8 kg of lead. 
This was actually found to be not too difficult, though frightening on the little down climbs!

Approaching the end of my three weeks on the mountain, I finally had to accept that the sumps were out of my reach. 
I was exhausted through my efforts, making myself sick through not enough rest.

My last mad plan involving hijacking the ever eager Oli and spending essentially three days portering gear to the dive site, diving, and abandoning cylinders for the winter, was replaced by a rather more sane plan to explore the bottom, and, sadly, drag my cylinder out from camp.

I pulled my shoulder really quite badly during this trip, which made my slow exit from X-Ray hauling steel arduous and painful. 
The situation on the surface wasn't much more pleasant. 
The Bivi talk was full of suspicion that I would abandon without carrying all the dive gear (and, indeed, my unused photographic gear) down. 
So there was nothing to do but swipe opiates from the first aid kits, ignore my grinding bones and do my carrying duty. 
I must admit it was with considerable sadness and little will to return that I finally struck my tent, squeezed the last few bits into my rucksack, ached down the mountain and boarded a bus out of Tolmin.

My 8 kg of diving Lead sits at X-Ray currently labelled with a simple note:- ´Jarv's Folly¡

Everything is clear in hindsight. 
I should never have started preparing to dive, instead put my efforts into dry exploration & bolt climbing of the deep levels and, potentially, readying the ground for a diving trip in future years. 
Still, we live and learn, and ´Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a Heaven for?¡

## 2012 – Watership Up with Oli

Oli hadn't yet been on the serious pushing trip he was clearly capable of. 
Having abandoned diving plans, I went down with him on the standard two nighter. 
First stop, before bed, was the fabled Esoterica. 
This was quite an interesting place, being a streamway cutting through the Prince Consort Road horizontal level before the Albert Hall. 
The Serpentine stream at the Albert Hall almost certainly forms the development which goes all the way to Watership Down, there's every reason to believe this streamway may proceed similarly. 
However, tails of wet rift from the original explorers (James KP and Jan in 2010) have dissuaded a return. 
We found the climb down through the boulders, and arrived at the 10 m pitch (taking water from the little inlet in the left of Prince Consort Road) I'd previously stood at. 
We commenced bolting, taking turns.

While Oli was tapping away, I climbed over the rift pitch, down a 4 metre free climb and intersected a different stream. 
This stream came down (on the left) from an easily gained chamber, with vast quantity of beautiful haemetite on the shelves. 
The continuation (to the right & following the stream down) was obvious, and I can only assume that this is 'Esoterica' as pushed by James KP and Jan.

I related this to Oli back at the pitch head. 
We finished the backup bolt no problem, but horror of horrors, broke the driver placing the hang bolt. 
A few minutes experimenting with alternative natural rigging (all too dodge) and we accepted unhappy defeat. 
Should have brought a second driver. 
Should have brought the drill. 
I left a long and meandering note underlining the point that this pitch was not dropped, and the way to what I believe is Esoterica.

It's one of those strange quirks of expedition – we had what seemed to be two independent streamways, both going and barely an hour away from camp. 
Yet no one returned here either.

Having decided returning to camp for a replacement driver was too long a round trip, I took Oli on a tourist trip to Palace of King Minos. 
We admired both the formations, the unpleasant nature of 'Guillotine' and the admirable efforts in bolt climbing the Queen's Bed Chamber, and returned via the Oroborus alternative to the Albert Hall – odd passage formation indeed.

### Day 2

We set off for the deep. 
I find Big Rock a rather unfriendly place. 
Though no one had been here since my previous trip (in 2011), I found a lot of the bolts disturbingly loose. 
Always a worry with rawl bolts; I also had dark thoughts of some kind of bolt loosening cave monster, which I imagined as some kind of spanner assisted sloth.

The way to Red Cow was almost second nature now – the third time in two years. 
I pointed out the few bits I'd figured out about the route on the way, and dealt the stack of playing cards I had filled my Meander pocket with (arrows and 'Red Cow' or 'Big Rock' to waymark the two opposite destinations). 
At Red Cow, we repacked and left a Daren drum and food stash, then continued on down to the bottom with a single bag of bolting kit, rope and survey gear. 
Oli made short work of the sideways wriggles in Winter Journey, and with sanity rather than wanderlust on our side we set about rigging the steep muddy climbs which Clare & I had slithered down and had such trouble climbing. 
While I merrily tapped in the first bolt, Oli had a quick look at the 'upwind' route from the T-junction and came back shortly having wandered to the bottom of a climb he didn't fancy by himself.

At the main climb, I realised I'd rigged the scrappy ropes we'd brought in the wrong length order – Oli sorted this out behind me while I placed a Y-hang off the opposite walls. 
The depth of the dry silt was impressive – I chiseled off 5cm deep plates from both walls to find the rock.

Arriving at the sump with rather more poise and grace than last time, we noted that the plastic PSS at the shore edge had floated off into the sump – clearly the level had increased (at least minutely) at some point during the previous two weeks. 
I also threw a few rocks in the sump to try and gauge how deep it was (4m I estimate) and stomped in the shallows a bit to try and assess the visibility for diving potential (remarkably good, surprisingly no brown mud, the coarse sand settling very quickly). 
 Wearing my wet socks, I was trying to psyche myself up into traversing along the right hand (sloping rock ledge) of the sump to try and assess whether it continued around the corner, or stopped with a rock wall.

Oli reckoned he could have a chance at the balcony, and prussic'd up the rope before swinging across. 
He left the rope pulled over, but having got together our survey instruments I grew bored of waiting for him to return, and flicked the rope off to follow.

The level gained, Watership Up, was really quite interesting – very difficult to tell how it formed, other than the obvious bedding plane bit and with strange (large!) echoes leading off from tight rifts. 
Following the natural route past puddles of Hematite and along a protracted flat out squeeze we came to a section of rift with a drop down onto a lake. 
This was a definite lake, as we could see both ends of the body of water, but otherwise looked very similar to the main sump. 
The pitchhead down from the rift would be narrow but certainly doable. 
We surveyed our way back, notably there was a collection of those strange spider-web like filaments covered with droplets in a cranny of the rock. 
Always a bit spooky when you come across them – no matter how much one reminds oneself that they must be some kind of slime mold or fungus, the image of a massive cave spider is hard to shake!

With time already surprisingly tight, and a long way to climb, we set off out, pulling all the ropes up with a bittersweet melancholy. 
We had put the rigging effort in to further the next party, and effortlessly found passage, but there remained so many question marks, and no other parties intended to return down here this year.

Back at Redcow we toasted our mackerel with a splash of the meths recovered from 'daydreamers', and then had a warm Vitaminski (pusher's delight). 
We filled up our Daren drum with water – measuring the Red Cow stream as 1L/s (by filling a 6L Daren drum in a timed 10s, capturing about 60% of the stream). 
This Daren, along with the 'bivi liberated' mess tin and blue 2L Sigg bottle (with perhaps 200ml of meths left) was left sitting in the sand of the main red cow passage. 
There was talk of bolt climbers making their way down this way to investigate 'Strap on the Nitro'. 
This didn't happen, and so those resources stand there currently, awaiting the 2013 developments.

The slog on home to X-Ray continued with little comment – other than I managed to pull a shoulder on the Memory Lane climbs. 
We also managed to flood the passage with smoke by leaving the fish tin to burn itself out (also burning the paint). 
Interestingly, and in contradiction to the original explorers memories, the cave draft  took this in the direction of Big Rock, we found ourselves caving through this fug till at least Memory Lane.

The way out from X-Ray, with diving cylinder in tow, was slow indeed. 
I sent Oli off ahead, and laboured my way behind. 
Some of the Urinal series pitch heads were really quite acrobatic when dragging a third leg through!

## Prospect for 2013

Despite the success of the 2012 expedition, it is clear that there remains a large amount of cave to be discovered in Vrtnarija and Migovec. 
In Vrtnarija, the obvious areas to focus our attention on include: the descent of the wet pitches at the end of Brezno Slapov and Invictus, pushing the rift at the end of Milky Way, further exploration of Xanadu and Lower Pleasures, various unpushed leads in Watership Down at the bottom, and a second bolt climb to a window at Queens Bedchamber that seems to be the continuation of the horizontal development found in Milk Way. 
Furthermore, as we now have the necessary know-how and equipment to bolt climb, there are various ¡deep¢ leads to revisit from the 2003 expedition such as Strap on the Nitro. 


In some ways, we have the fortunate problem of almost being too successful in recent years, as the leads are now fairly spread out and getting further from camp each year. 
This year, it was common for pushing trips to Watership Down and Invictus/Atlantis to take upwards of 21 hours. 
Nonetheless, Camp X-Ray remains the most likely camp due to its central location and easy access to water -- however, an additional lightweight 2 man camp nearer to the more remote locations is a strong possibility. 


Thanks to the connection there are also old leads in the old SysMig that are worth revisiting, especially around the Waterloo area. 


In October 2012, on the annual ICCC/JSPDT ¡winter action¢ weekend, a breakthrough was made in Primadonna, another cave system on mountain. 
Due to its close proximity to the System, this will be the next big ¡connection¢ project in our bid to shed more light on the complex subterranean system under Migovec.
