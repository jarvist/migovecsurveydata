\chapter*{Editorial}

Looking back over the caving exploration between 2007 and 2012 it almost seems like it was a pre-ordained story; rags to riches, from a seemingly hollowed out mountain long past its glory days of exploration to the longest cave in Slovenia. 
Living it, it never seemed like this, rather a more confused and complicated picture, individuals actors without a script, pulling together in some vague direction but towards perhaps an achievable objective. 


If exploration were a rational expenditure of efforts towards a known end, the scenes would be rather more simple to describe - we realised how close we were to the connection of Vrtnarija and Kavkna Jama (M2) after more carefully analysing the 2007 "Kill 'em All" survey data. 
To pursue this, we rebolted and rerigged Kavkna Jama in 2008, while exploring on the other side in Vrtnarija. 
In 2009 we established a camp in Vrtnarija at the nearest suitable point to the closest approach, and used it to massively increase our time at the pushing front. 
In 2010, 2011 and 2012 we camped deeper in Vrtnarija, while pushing Kavkna Jama from the surface both during the Summer and on Autumn / Winter trips. 
In 2012 we connected the systems, forming the longest cave system in Slovenia, and one in which the vast majority of cave passage is at depths greater than 500 m.

However, this isn't the real story of exploration. 
Rather, it is the story of the people involved that is the true history of Migovec. 
For the connection was not made in the obvious location between Kavkna Jama and Vrtnarija, but down at 650 m of depth, as the result of yet another successful, to the point of routine, pushing trip. 

Motivated by the connection target, during 2008 we flung ourselves into the exploration of Captain Kangaroo, Vrtnarija. 
At the grim pushing front were the youngsters, highly motivated but lacking the experience to go deep. 
Lacking in time at the pushing front we determined to go back and camp in 2009. 


"The art of roughing it is in smoothing off the edges."
Stories of draughty campsites, cassette players slurring to an undignified quietness, shivering through the night, and unlabelled plastic bags of miscellaneous white powder were retold by the experienced members, and duly obsoleted by careful consideration of the logistics. 
We went back with free standing tents, layers of fleece, MP3 players, modern winter-mix gas stoves and LED fairy lights. 
We went back to stay, and almost effortlessly pushed this tough branch of the cave down to 550 m.

This new generation of cavers, who cut their teeth in Captain Kangaroo, suddenly found themselves with the endurance and know-how to successfully explore at depth. 
Though the connection of the systems were certainly still a major aim of 2010, 2011 and 2012 expeditions, we were mainly there to push deep new cave passage. 
We re-established Camp X-Ray (550 m deep) as our main base, and improved on it year after year till it became a truly palatial location. 
And now that the going was once again deep, we were rejoined by the more experienced members of our club, for whom the prospect of another grim rift in Captain Kangaroo was not suitably motivating. 
And as our collective abilities improved, normality shifted. 
Exploring over multi-day camping trips, hot bunking and the considerable feat of endurance just to reach and return from these depths became standard practice. 
That which was just-possible the year before became the standard trip, that which was beyond our reach became achievable.

I am proud of the time that I have dedicated towards these expeditions, and every moment spent with the people involved. 
There are others in the club who have contributed very much more.
We were all volunteers - we did all this because we wanted to, but little would get done if we only did things that were fun. 

Spending your free-time down caving stores fettling kit is neither particularly enjoyable nor directly rewarding. 
Carries in the hail and rain are arduous and unpleasant. 
I don't think it is possible for this document to understate the sacrifice of time and effort made by expedition members and friends. 
Forever lacking in adequate funding and gear, unrecognised and often misunderstood, we have achieved our exploration on a wing and a prayer. 


This exploration report is dedicated to our many friends who assisted, sponsored, carried, hosted and advised. 
You all contributed to the achievements documented herein.

And so, Ninety-Nine years after Apsley Cherry-Garrard returned to South Kensington with the Penguins Eggs, we return to our college with a minor news story and a few pretty photos for their website. 
For those involved in the exploration of Tolminski Migovec far more precious are the memories of friendships formed deep within the Hollow Mountain. 
The prize was not the destination we arrived at, but the path we forged in getting here.

We were always in the longest cave in Slovenia, we just hadn't realised.

\begin{verse}
We shall not cease from exploration  \\
And the end of all our exploring  \\
Will be to arrive where we started  \\
And know the place for the first time. 
 \\
Through the unknown, unremembered gate  \\
When the last of earth left to discover  \\
Is that which was the beginning;  \\
At the source of the longest river  \\
The voice of the hidden waterfall \\
\end{verse}
