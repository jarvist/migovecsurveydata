There are 0 loops.
Total length of survey legs =  133.60m ( 133.60m adjusted)
Total plan length of survey legs =  115.47m
Total vertical length of survey legs =   46.40m
Vertical range = 43.44m (from brez_volje.bv32 at 43.44m to brez_volje.pop22 at 0.00m)
North-South range = 78.35m (from brez_volje.bv32 at 78.35m to brez_volje.pop22 at 0.00m)
East-West range = 44.84m (from brez_volje.bv32 at 43.65m to brez_volje.bv2 at -1.18m)
